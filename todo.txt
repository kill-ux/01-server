// parsing the http request using the content-length 
1  - Read the start line and headers from the stream.
Look for Content-Length in the headers.
If Content-Length exists:
Read exactly that number of bytes to get the body.
After the body is fully read:
If more bytes are available, start parsing the next HTTP message immediately.
If Content-Length is missing (and no Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used), we might have to infer the end of the body by other means (e.g., closing the connection).
